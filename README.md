# Virtual Colon
Spatiotemporal modelling of metabolic interactions in a computational colonic environment
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository contains the source and input files needed to run the Virtual Colon. 

- The Mono-colonalisation.R file simulates mono-colonisation experiments with context-specific colonic cell.
  
- The SIHUMIx.R file context-specific colonic cells with the SIHUMIx minimal model microbiome.

It requires the following software / R packages:
1. R
2. sybil
3. BacArena
4. cplexAPI

The gplkAPI would theoritically suffice instead of cplexAPI. However, it is not tested and may lead to significant increase of computational time.
